# RDF

- RDF stands for Resource Description Framework
- RDF is designed to be read and understood by computers
- Primary goal is to exchange data on web while preserving the original meaning.
- Representation can be in form of **triples** and **graphs**
- Triples are flexible and connect like a graph, Forming a Knowledge Graph.
- Triples have a subject, predicate and an object & are enclosed within angular brackets

Example: Delhi is capital of India  
`<Delhi> <capital of> <India>`

The triples can also be represented in the form of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier)

```
<https://www.abc.org/subject/Delhi> 
<https://www.abc.org/predicate/capitalOf> 
<https://www.abc.org/object/India>.
```
