# The Feasibility Study

Determines whether a project is viable before full investment.

Types of Feasibility:

1. Technical – Can it be built with current technology?
2. Economic – Is it cost-effective?
3. Operational – Will users accept and use it?
4. Legal – Is it within laws/regulations?
5. Schedule – Can it be completed on time?
