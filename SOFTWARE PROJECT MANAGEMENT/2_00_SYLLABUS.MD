# 🧩 **UNIT 1 – Software Project Management Fundamentals**

---

## 💠 **1. Importance of Software Project Management**

Software projects are **large, complex, and resource-intensive**, so effective management is essential to ensure they:

* ✅ Meet **customer requirements** and quality standards
* ✅ Finish **within time and budget**
* ✅ Handle **changes, risks, and resources** efficiently
* ✅ Improve **coordination and communication**
* ✅ Provide **predictability** and accountability

Without project management → delays, cost overruns, and failures are common.

---

## 💠 **2. What Is a Project?**

A **project** is a **temporary, goal-oriented endeavor** undertaken to create a **unique product or service**.

**Characteristics:**

* Defined **objectives and scope**
* Fixed **start and end dates**
* Requires **planning, execution, and control**
* Utilizes **limited resources**
* Produces a **specific deliverable**

**Examples:** Developing an app, building a database system, or launching a website.

---

## 💠 **3. Problems with Software Projects**

1. **Unclear Requirements**
2. **Unrealistic Schedule or Budget**
3. **Scope Creep** (continuous changes)
4. **Poor Communication**
5. **Inadequate Risk Management**
6. **Lack of Skilled Staff**
7. **Weak Project Leadership**
8. **Poor Estimation and Control**

---

## 💠 **4. What Is Project Management?**

> “Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.” — *PMBOK*

**Key Functions:**

1. **Planning** – defining tasks, schedule, budget
2. **Organizing** – assigning roles & responsibilities
3. **Leading** – motivating the team
4. **Controlling** – monitoring progress and making corrections

---

## 💠 **5. Stakeholders in a Software Project**

People or groups **affected by** or **involved in** the project:

| **Stakeholder**            | **Role**                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Customer/Client**        | Defines needs, funds project        |
| **Project Manager**        | Plans and controls execution        |
| **Developers/Testers**     | Build and test software             |
| **Users**                  | Use the final system                |
| **Sponsor**                | Provides resources and support      |
| **Vendors/Subcontractors** | Supply tools, software, or services |

---

## 💠 **6. Stages of a Project**

1. **Initiation** – Idea generation, feasibility check
2. **Planning** – Define scope, resources, schedule, risks
3. **Execution** – Develop and implement
4. **Monitoring & Control** – Track performance, adjust plans
5. **Closure** – Deliver product, release team, evaluate outcomes

---

## 💠 **7. The Feasibility Study**

Determines whether a project is **viable** before full investment.

**Types of Feasibility:**

* **Technical** – Can it be built with current technology?
* **Economic** – Is it cost-effective?
* **Operational** – Will users accept and use it?
* **Legal** – Is it within laws/regulations?
* **Schedule** – Can it be completed on time?

✅ Output: **Feasibility Report** → Go / No-Go decision.

---

## 💠 **8. Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)**

Compares **expected costs** vs **expected benefits** of a project.

[
\text{Net Benefit} = \text{Total Benefits} - \text{Total Costs}
]

If benefits outweigh costs → project is **worth pursuing**.

**Steps:**

1. Identify all costs & benefits
2. Quantify in monetary terms
3. Discount future values (if needed)
4. Compare totals

---

## 💠 **9. Cost–Benefit Evaluation Techniques**

| **Technique**                     | **Meaning**                             | **Considers Time Value?** |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Payback Period**                | Time to recover investment              | ❌                         |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)**    | Profit % on investment                  | ❌                         |
| **Net Present Value (NPV)**       | Discounted inflows – outflows           | ✅                         |
| **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** | Rate where NPV = 0                      | ✅                         |
| **Profitability Index**           | Ratio of PV of inflows / PV of outflows | ✅                         |

---

## 💠 **10. Cash-Flow Forecasting**

Predicts **future inflows and outflows of cash** to ensure liquidity during the project.

**Formula:**
[
\text{Net Cash Flow} = \text{Cash Inflows} - \text{Cash Outflows}
]

Helps in:

* Budgeting
* Investment planning
* Avoiding cash shortages

**Types:** Operating, Investing, Financing Cash Flows.

# 🧭 **UNIT 2 – Project Initiation and Planning**

---

## 💠 **1. Steps in Project Initiation**

1. **Idea Identification** – Recognize need or opportunity
2. **Preliminary Investigation** – Initial data collection
3. **Feasibility Study** – Technical, economic, operational analysis
4. **Business Case Preparation** – Justify the project
5. **Project Charter Creation** – Officially authorize the project

---

## 💠 **2. Business Case**

Explains **why** the project should be undertaken.

**Contents:**

* Problem or opportunity
* Objectives and expected outcomes
* Cost estimates and benefits
* Risks and alternatives
* Recommendation for approval

Acts as the **decision document** for management.

---

## 💠 **3. Project Charter**

> The **formal authorization document** that officially starts the project.

**Includes:**

* Project title, sponsor, and manager
* Objectives and deliverables
* Major milestones
* Budget summary
* Roles and responsibilities
* Approval signatures

Once signed → the project manager gets **authority to proceed**.

---

## 💠 **4. Steps in Project Planning**

1. Define **scope and objectives**
2. Identify **deliverables**
3. Create **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
4. Estimate **time, cost, and resources**
5. Develop **schedule** (Gantt/PERT charts)
6. Plan **risk management**
7. Establish **communication & quality plans**

---

## 💠 **5. Team Contract**

A **mutual agreement** among team members describing:

* Roles and responsibilities
* Communication protocols
* Conflict-resolution approach
* Meeting frequency
* Performance expectations

Encourages **discipline and accountability**.

---

## 💠 **6. Defining Scope and Objectives**

* **Scope:** Boundaries of what the project will and will not deliver
* **Objectives:** Specific, measurable goals (SMART)

**Example:**

> “Develop an e-commerce website for local retailers within 6 months using MERN stack.”

---

## 💠 **7. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

A **hierarchical decomposition** of the total project into smaller, manageable components (work packages).

**Purpose:**

* Organize work logically
* Facilitate scheduling and costing
* Assign clear responsibilities

**Example:**

```
E-Commerce Project
 ├── Frontend Design
 ├── Backend Development
 ├── Database Setup
 ├── Testing & Deployment
```

---

## 💠 **8. Deliverables and Other Products**

**Deliverables:** Tangible or measurable outcomes like

* Software modules
* Reports
* Documentation
* Training materials

**Supporting Products:** Tools, prototypes, or test data created during development.

---

## 💠 **9. Time, Cost, and Resource Estimation**

### a) **Time Estimation**

* Break tasks using WBS
* Use methods like **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)** or **Gantt Charts**
* Formula for PERT:
  [
  TE = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
  ]
  (O = Optimistic, M = Most likely, P = Pessimistic)

### b) **Cost Estimation**

Includes:

* Hardware & software cost
* Personnel salaries
* Training & maintenance

Methods: **Expert judgment**, **analogous**, **parametric**, or **bottom-up** estimation.

### c) **Resource Estimation**

Identify:

* Human resources (developers, testers)
* Equipment and infrastructure
* Tools and technologies

Aim: **Optimize usage and avoid bottlenecks**
