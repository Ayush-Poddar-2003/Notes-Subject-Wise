# INTRODUCTION

Delivery of computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) over the Internet (“the Cloud”) instead of using local computers or personal servers.

Allows users to access and store data/applications on remote servers rather than their local devices.

Organizations use clouds for:  
Data backup and recovery, Hosting websites and applications, Software development and testing, Big data analytics, Email and productivity tools

CHARACTERISTICS
1. **On-demand self-service**:  
Users can directly access computing resources.
2. **Broad network access**:  
Services are available from any device.
3. **Resource pooling**:  
Resources are shared among multiple users dynamically.
4. **Rapid elasticity**:  
Resources can be scaled up/down quickly depending on demand.
5. **Measured service**:  
Users are billed only for the amount of resources they use.
