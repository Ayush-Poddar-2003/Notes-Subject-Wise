# Evolution of Mobile Computing Services
Ability to use computing devices while moving.  
Evolution has progressed from basic voice calls to modern multimedia services.

Key milestones:

- Early Mobile Telephony: Analog voice services.
- Digital Mobile Systems: Introduction of data services.
- Smartphones and IoT Devices: High-speed internet, multimedia apps.

# Personal Communication Services (PCS) Architecture

Set of wireless communications capabilities allowing voice, data, and messaging services.

Components:

- Mobile Station (MS): User device (phone, tablet).
- Base Station Subsystem (BSS): Connects mobile devices to the network.
  - Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
  - Base Station Controller (BSC)
- Network Subsystem (NSS): Core network handling switching, authentication.
- Operation & Support Subsystem (OSS): Network management.

# Cellular Network Concept and Design

Cellular Concept: Coverage area is divided into cells, each with its own base station.

Advantages:
- Frequency reuse
- Better coverage
- Increased capacity

Design Considerations:
- Cell size
- Antenna placement
- Frequency allocation


---
# Network Signalling

Mechanism for controlling calls and mobility.

Types:
- Call Setup Signalling: Establishing a call.
- Handoff Signalling: Switching cell during movement.
- Paging Signalling: Locating mobile users.


---
# Frequency Reuse
Same frequency channels are reused in non-adjacent cells.  
Improves spectrum efficiency.  
Cluster concept: Group of cells where frequencies are reused after a fixed distance.

---
# Handoff & Mobility Management

Handoff: Transfer of an ongoing call from one cell to another.  
Types: Hard (break-before-make), Soft (make-before-break)

Mobility Management: Tracks location and ensures seamless connectivity.
- Location updates
- Paging
- Registration

# Improving Coverage and Capacity

Sectoring: Dividing a cell into sectors with directional antennas.  
Cell Splitting: Dividing large cells into smaller ones to increase capacity.  
Benefits: Reduced interference, better signal quality, higher user capacity.
