**Q1. Explain the concept of Mobility Landscape. Discuss how the growth of mobile adoption has influenced user-centric services.**

**Mobility Landscape:**  
Entire **ecosystem** of mobile technologies, devices, applications, networks, and services that enable **users** to **stay connected anywhere, anytime**.  
It includes smartphones, wireless networks (4G/5G), cloud services, IoT devices, and mobile platforms.

**Impact of Mobile Adoption on User-Centric Services:**

1. **Personalization:**  
Apps and services now adapt to user behavior, location, and preferences.
2. **Real-Time Access:**  
Services like banking, shopping, and learning are available 24×7.
3. **Context-Aware Services:**  
Systems use sensors (GPS, accelerometer) to deliver relevant experiences.
4. **Social Connectivity:**  
Mobile adoption has made social media and communication apps integral to daily life.
5. **On-Demand Services:**  
Rise of food delivery, transport, and entertainment apps.


The growing mobility landscape has transformed traditional services into intelligent, user-centered, and context-aware experiences.

**Q2. Describe Fixed, Mobile and IP Convergence. What are its key benefits for users and service providers?**

FMIC :  
Integration of fixed-line communication (**broadband**), mobile networks (**cellular**), & Internet Protocol (**IP**) services into one unified infrastructure.

**Key Components:**

1. **Fixed Networks:** Wired broadband (DSL, fiber).
2. **Mobile Networks:** Cellular technologies (4G/5G).
3. **IP Networks:** Packet-switched Internet backbone.

**Benefits:**
**For Users:**

* Seamless connectivity across home, office, and mobile networks.
* Single device and subscription for multiple services.
* Better Quality of Service (QoS) and user experience.

**For Service Providers:**

* Lower operational cost (shared infrastructure).
* Simplified management and service delivery.
* New service opportunities like unified communication and VoIP.

**Diagram (conceptual):**

```
[Fixed Line]      [Mobile Network]
     \                /
      \              /
       \            /
         → [IP Core Network] → Internet/Services
```

**Q3. Define Intelligent Environments and explain how context-aware services enhance user mobility. Provide a real-life example.**

A space equipped with sensors, devices, and communication technologies that can perceive user context and act automatically to assist them.

**Context-Aware Services:**  
These services sense information such as location, time, activity, and preferences to deliver relevant content or actions.

**Enhancement of User Mobility:**

1. Adapts to user movement and location.
2. Reduces manual interaction — systems act autonomously.
3. Enables smart, seamless experiences across devices.

**Real-Life Example:**

* A smart home that adjusts lighting and temperature when you enter.
* Google Maps suggesting alternate routes based on live traffic and your commute pattern.

**Q4. (a) What is a Sensor Network? List and briefly explain any three sensor technologies used in context-aware computing.**

A Sensor Network : group of spatially distributed sensors  
connected wirelessly  
to collect and transmit environmental or user data for processing.

**Three Common Sensor Technologies:**

1. **GPS Sensors:** Detect user’s geographic location for navigation or location-based services.
2. **Accelerometers:** Measure movement, tilt, and orientation — used in activity tracking.
3. **Proximity Sensors:** Detect nearby objects or devices — used in auto-screen off or gesture control.

**(b) Role of Sensor Networks in Enabling Smart Filtering and Social Context Sharing**

**Smart Filtering:**

* Sensors collect contextual data (location, movement, environment).
* The system filters irrelevant information and provides only relevant notifications or updates.

**Social Context Sharing:**

* Enables users to automatically share status or activity (e.g., “At gym”, “Driving”).
* Improves social awareness and connected experiences.

**Example:**
Fitness apps use motion and GPS sensors to detect a run and share activity on social media automatically.

**Q5. (a) What is User-Centred Design (UCD)? Explain its key principles.**

A design philosophy that places the end user’s needs, limitations, and feedback at the core of every design stage.

**Key Principles:**

1. **User Involvement:** Active participation of users throughout the design process.
2. **Iterative Design:** Continuous testing and improvement.
3. **Empathy:** Understanding users’ emotions, needs, and contexts.
4. **Usability Goals:** Focus on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
5. **Feedback Integration:** Real user feedback drives design refinement.

---

**(b) Outline the Iterative Big Loop Process of UCD with its Major Stages**

**The UCD Big Loop Process involves continuous improvement through feedback and testing.**

**Stages:**

1. **Understand Context of Use** – Identify users, tasks, and environments.
2. **Specify Requirements** – Define functional and usability goals.
3. **Design Solutions** – Create prototypes and interfaces.
4. **Evaluate with Users** – Conduct usability tests and gather feedback.
5. **Refine and Repeat** – Iterate until goals are achieved.

**Loop Diagram:**

```
[Understand Context] → [Specify Requirements] → [Design Solutions] 
        ↑                                       ↓
        ←---------- [Evaluate & Refine] --------
```

**Essence:**

> UCD is an ongoing loop ensuring the product always evolves around real user needs.
