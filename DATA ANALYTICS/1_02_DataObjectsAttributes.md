# Getting to Know Your Data: Data Objects and Attribute Types


### Data Objects ?
A data object (also called record, instance, sample, or tuple)  
represents a real-world entity such as a student, product, transaction, or YouTube video.  
Each data object is described using a set of attributes.

---
### Attribute (Feature) ?
An attribute is a property or characteristic of a data object.  
Examples: Name, Age, Gender, Marks, Height.

**Types of Attributes :-**

**1. Nominal Attributes -**  
Represent names, categories, or labels.  
No order or ranking between values.  
Numerical values (if used) have no meaning.  
Examples:  
Gender (Male/Female), Colors (Red/Blue), Country (India/USA), YouTube category (Music/Education).

**2. Binary Attributes -**  
A special case of nominal attributes with only two values.

2.1 Symmetric binary:  
Both values are equally important.  
Examples: Gender, Yes/No, True/False.

2.2 Asymmetric binary:  
One value is more important, usually the "positive" case.  
Examples: Fraud (Yes/No), Medical test (Positive/Negative), Accident (Yes/No).

**3. Ordinal Attributes**  
Values have a meaningful order or ranking.    
But the difference between the ranks is unknown.  
Examples:
Grades (A, B, C), Shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL), Feedback levels (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), Education level.

**4. Numeric Attributes**  
Numeric values where mathematical operations make sense.

Discrete Attributes:-  
Finite or countable values.  
Usually integers.  
Examples:  
Number of subscribers, number of likes, number of children, number of transactions.

Continuous Attributes:-  
Can take any real value within a range.  
Usually measurements.  
Examples:
Height, weight, temperature, time, speed.
Summary Table  

Nominal: No order; labels only.  
Binary: Two values; can be symmetric or asymmetric.  
Ordinal: Ordered categories; differences not measured.   
Numeric: Real numbers; can be discrete or continuous.
