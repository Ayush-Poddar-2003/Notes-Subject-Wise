## Quartiles
Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.

Q1 (First Quartile): 25% of data

Q2 (Second Quartile / Median): 50% of data

Q3 (Third Quartile): 75% of data

These help in understanding how data is spread across positions.

### 3. Variance

Variance measures how far each value is from the mean on average.

Formula (for population variance):

Variance = Σ (xi – mean)² / N

High variance → data is widely spread

Low variance → data is close to mean

---
### 4. Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

Formula:
Standard Deviation = √Variance

It shows the average distance of values from the mean.

---
### 5. Interquartile Range (IQR)

IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

Formula:
IQR = Q3 – Q1

Removes the effect of extreme values (outliers).

Useful for skewed data.

Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data

Graphic displays help us understand patterns, distribution, and relationships in data quickly.
They are commonly used in data analysis and visualization.

Common types include:

1. Histogram

Shows the frequency distribution of continuous data.

Data is divided into bins (intervals).

Helps identify the shape of distribution: normal, skewed, etc.

2. Bar Chart

Represents categorical data.

Bars show frequency or count of each category.

3. Pie Chart

Shows the proportional distribution of categories.

Each slice represents a category’s percentage.

4. Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)

Shows the spread of data using Q1, median, Q3, and outliers.

Useful for comparing multiple datasets.

5. Scatter Plot

Shows relationship between two numeric variables.

Helps identify correlation patterns.
