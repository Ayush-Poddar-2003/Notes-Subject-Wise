# DATA REDUCTION

A technique used to reduce the size of a dataset, while preserving the most important information.  
Beneficial in situations where the dataset is too large,  
or where dataset contains large amount of irrelevant/redundant information.

#### 1. Dimension Reduction
Reducing the number of features either by removing or  
by combining multiple features into a single feature.
1. SWFS : Step wise forward selection
2. SWBS : Step wise backward elimination

#### 2. Data Compression
1. Loseless : If reversed & we get original data when decompressed
2. Lossy 

#### 3. Numerosity Reduction
1. Parametic : Only outliers are stored, regression, linear models
2. Non Parametic : historams

#### 4. Discretization
Divides into intervals.
