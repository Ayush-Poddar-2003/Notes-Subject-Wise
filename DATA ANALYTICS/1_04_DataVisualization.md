# Data Visualization

Data visualization uses graphical techniques to represent data in a meaningful and easy-to-understand way.

Below are different visualization categories.

1. Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques

Used when the dataset is very large (millions of data values).

Each data value is mapped to a colored pixel.

The screen displays patterns based on color intensity.

Advantages:

Good for high-dimensional data.

Efficient for large datasets.

Examples:

Pixel displays of stock trends

Heatmaps

Pixel bar charts

2. Geometric Projection Visualization Techniques

Project high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces (2D or 3D).

Focuses on geometric transformations to show patterns.

Examples:

Scatter plot matrices

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots

3D projections

Parallel coordinate plots

Use case:
To identify clusters, outliers, and correlations.

---
3. Icon-Based Visualization Techniques

Each data object is represented as an icon with different shapes, colors, or facial features.

Visual attributes of the icon encode data values.

Examples:

Chernoff Faces (each facial feature represents an attribute)

Stick figure icons

Glyphs and star diagrams

Benefit:
Humans can easily recognize patterns through visual symbols.

---
4. Hierarchical Visualization Techniques

Used for data that has a tree-like / hierarchical structure.

Examples:

Treemaps

Dendrograms

Radial tree diagrams

Sunburst charts

Advantages:

Shows parent-child relationships

Useful for file systems, organizational data, biological taxonomy

----
5. Visualizing Complex Data and Relations

For datasets that are very large, multi-dimensional, or have complex connections.

Techniques include:

a) Network Graph Visualization

Shows relationships between entities

Used in social networks, web graphs, communication networks

b) Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

Projects complex relationships into 2D/3D for easier understanding

c) Parallel Coordinates

Visualizes many attributes at once

Helpful for classification and regression tasks

d) Cluster and Heatmap Visualizations

Useful for pattern recognition
